# Rancid Tomatillos React App

Welcome to the Rancid Tomatillos React App! This application is designed to help movie enthusiasts search for movies, view their details, and rate them. It includes dynamic and asynchronous search functionality and utilizes Cypress for testing purposes.

## Features

1. **Movie Search:** Users can search for movies by title. The search functionality is dynamic and asynchronous, providing instant results as the user types.

2. **Movie Details:** Clicking on a movie in the search results displays detailed information about the selected movie, including the synopsis, release date, director, and ratings.

3. **Rating and Reviews:** Users can rate movies on a scale of 1 to 5 stars and leave personalized reviews to share their opinions with others.

4. **Testing with Cypress:** The app includes automated tests using Cypress, a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework. These tests ensure that the app functions correctly and reliably.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
